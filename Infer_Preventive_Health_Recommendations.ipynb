      "2. Cardiovascular disease prevention: Given your family history of cardiovascular disease, it's important to take steps to prevent it. I recommend incorporating more heart-healthy foods into your diet, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Additionally, regular exercise can help keep your heart healthy.\n",
      "\n",

      "4. Osteoporosis prevention: As a woman over the age of 50, you are at an increased risk for osteoporosis. I recommend incorporating weight-bearing exercises into your routine, such as walking or lifting weights, to help keep your bones strong. Additionally, make sure you are getting enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet.\n",
