Chat GPT can be helpful for physicians reviewing clinical records in several ways:

### Efficient Data Extraction   
  Chat GPT can assist in automatically extracting relevant data points, such as:
 
- Patient Demographics
- Medical History
- Medications
- Lab Results
- Diagnoses  
    

In this manner, it can be used to **analyze text and generate structured summaries**.

### Decision Support  
- Analyzing clinical records and offering insights based on patterns, guidelines, and previous similar cases. 
- Identify potential drug interactions
- Flag abnormal test results  
- Suggest further diagnostic tests or treatment options  
- Provide evidence-based recommendations  

### Documentation Assistance  
- Aid in generating accurate and comprehensive clinical notes by analyzing the clinical records and providing suggestions for relevant information to include
- Help with formatting, grammar, and terminology consistency, resulting in more efficient and standardized documentation.

### Natural Language Interface  
- Ask questions in plain language, such as "What was the patient's blood pressure during the last visit?" or "Has the patient reported any allergies?"
- Interpret these queries, search the clinical records, and provide relevant answers, saving time and improving accessibility to patient information.
